    I was lucky to be selected for the Nebraska.Code() conference, which is the first regional conference I've spoken at. I did my <i>Going The Extra Mile With Entity Framework Code First</i> presentation that I've given quite a bit recently at a bunch of local user group, and was thankful for the practice. There's a big different from the first time you've given the presentation and you're focusing on the content, to when you're quite familiar with the content and can focus on the delivery. It was a fun event and a big deal for me to be able to speak.
