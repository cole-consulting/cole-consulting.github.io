    I helped plan another Cedar Valley BarCamp this year. It's a rewarding experience for me because since I work remotely now I feel I'm slowly losing touch with the local community. This year I redesigned the website and decided to host using GitHub Pages, which is a neat platform that I wish I was able to work with more. I helped gather sponsors for the event, assisted with setup and teardown, and helped delegate tasks throughout the planning process. I've been involved with Cedar Valley BarCamp since the first event and we had a great team this year.
