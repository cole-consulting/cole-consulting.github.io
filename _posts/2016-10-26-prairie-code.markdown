    This was the inaugural Prairie.Code() conference and I was happy to be chosen to speak. I gave my <i>The Trials And Tribulations Of Being A Fully Remote Developer</i> for the first time at a large conference, and I think it went pretty well. I also caught a lot of great sessions and got to reconnect with some of the other speakers that I haven't spoken with lately. It was a great event at a good venue. The Amegala guys know what they're doing.
