I gave my <i>The Trials And Tribulations Of Being A Fully Remote Developer</i> presentation at CRINETA to a nice crowd. Greg Sohl is the leader of the group and he's such a great steward for developers in Iowa, so I'm always happy to help. I enjoy this giving this talk because it always leads to interesting discussion afterwards and I often add/tweak the content based on that discussion.
