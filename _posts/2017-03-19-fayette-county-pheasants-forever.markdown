My wife and I were happy to be Grand Sponsors for the 2017 Fayette County Pheasants Forever Banquet. I grew up in Fayette County and enjoyed pheasant and deer hunting, as well as trout fishing. I'm always happy to support Pheasants Forever because they do a lot of local projects and you see your money at work. My daughter also won a .22 rifle at the raffle so I'll have to lock that up for a few years. My son won a BB gun and he's just about the age to learn how to shoot responsibly.
