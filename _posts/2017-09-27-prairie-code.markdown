    I attended Prairie.Code() in Des Moines for a few days. I did not speak at this event and enjoyed being able to consume content without the stress of presenting. There were a lot of DevOps related topics, and one of the presenters recommended <i>The Phoenix Project</i> so I bought it on Audible and listened to it on the way home. What a great story that a lot of us can relate to. I really enjoyed the format because it wasn't just dry information.

    I also saw Arthur Doler's presentation on mental health in our industry. It was a touching session that discussed a topic that is uncomfortable for a lot of us to address.
