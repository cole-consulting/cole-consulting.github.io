We had Mitchel Sellers give his <i>Confronting Your Fears, Entity Framework Deep Dive</i> to a nice sized crowd. A lot of great conversation followed. In addition to helping plan the event, I also picked up Mitchel from the airport because he has his pilot license and flies to many events (how cool is that?). It was a great presentation given by a true expert that debunked a lot of misinformation about Entity Framework. I highly recommend attending this presentation in the future if you have the opportunity.
