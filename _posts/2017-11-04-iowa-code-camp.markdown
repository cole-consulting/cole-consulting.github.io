    This was another great Iowa Code Camp event. This time I gave my <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11bzL7cj_9W-Pdu-d7w53NjwrDNOC7HtHisuNA3vl-9k/edit?usp=sharing">The Trials and Tribulations of Fully Remote Teams</a> presentation again, and got some great feedback and ideas to enhance the content. I'm looking forward to giving this again in the future because it's such a great, timely topic.

    The speaker dinner was great, the afterparty was great, watching Iowa smash Ohio State was great, and it's always nice to catch up with other devs around Iowa that I don't always get to talk to. It also looks like I might help coordinate the event in the Spring.
