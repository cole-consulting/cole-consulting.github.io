Our local CVINETA .NET User Group meeting was on November 6th at Old Chicago. This was a lighting round setup with multiple people participating. In addition to being a leader that helped coordinate the event, I talked about a few things, including <a href="/content/Creating And Maintaining Chocolatey Packages (Lightnight Talk).pdf">Creating And Maintaining Chocolatey Packages</a> and some tips I recently learned from a presenter at Iowa Code Camp about generating code using Excel based on a .csv data file.
