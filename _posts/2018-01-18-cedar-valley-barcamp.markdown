    Cedar Valley BarCamp is just around the corner, and the BarCamp team has been busy planning. This year we're really trying to boost attendance from 50ish to 100ish. We're adding headlining speakers this year
    to try to draw in additional crowds that we usually get.

<p>
    Along with this comes creating/maintaining the website (<a href="http://barcampcv.com/">http://barcampcv.com</a>) as a GitHub Pages website. GitHub Pages is a perfect fit because it's free and our content
    changes so infrequently. Additional responsibilities include seeking donations from area businesses, general coordination and delegation, handling lunch, and whatever else pops up.

    The event is on March 3, so stop on over to the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?ll=42.513698,-92.463516&z=16&t=m&hl=en-US&gl=US&mapclient=embed&cid=15992661642438866294">Business and Community Services building on the UNI Campus</a> to hear some local speakers, network with great people in the Cedar Valley, and stuff your face.
