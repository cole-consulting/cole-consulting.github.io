    I gave a brand spanking new conference presentation this year: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RIPHKgcLd0ORnI65QXCcLnHuXa4QdASYQtepzp2ii5U/edit?usp=sharing">GitHub Pages: A Platform For Cheapskates</a> to a great room of people. There seemed to be a ton of interest and a lot of hallway talk afterwards. Another good Amegala conference!

    Even though I was almost late to my own presentation (set a second alarm...) it went pretty well:
