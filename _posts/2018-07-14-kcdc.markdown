    This was my first <a href="https://www.kcdc.info/">KCDC</a> and it was incredible. The leaders ran the conference very well. I was impressed with how thoughtful they were to the speakers, including perks like a sweet hotel, a great party, neat shirts, and a photographer to take headshots.

    I gave a presentation that was new to a conference, but I had given it at a user group: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RIPHKgcLd0ORnI65QXCcLnHuXa4QdASYQtepzp2ii5U/edit?usp=sharing">GitHub Pages: A Platform For Cheapskates</a>. This was really my first technical presentation outside of the Microsoft stack. I host this site, <a href="https://colemike.com/">my personal blog</a>, and a few sites for local groups on GitHub Pages for free, and it's pretty easy to do once you wrap your head around the concept of static site generators. I was happy to talk to a few people after the session about how they might use it. As always I came away with a lot of ideas on how to add more compelling content and improve some rough spots.

    I definitely recommend attending KCDC at least once, but if you have the opportunity to speak I hope you're able to. This was probably my favorite conference I've ever attended.
