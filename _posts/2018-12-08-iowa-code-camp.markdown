    I always enjoy Iowa Code Camp because there's so many local technology experts and it's their time to shine. This year I gave two presentations, as well as joined the Iowa Code Camp leadership team. I'm looking forward to giving back to the conference that gave me a real career boost.

    The first presentation I gave was one I've given many times: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11bzL7cj_9W-Pdu-d7w53NjwrDNOC7HtHisuNA3vl-9k/edit?usp=sharing">The Trials And Tribulations Of Being A Fully Remote Developer</a>. This always develops into a healthy group discussion. I've noticed there's a lot more audience participation now than there was several years ago when I started giving this. There's a lot more people that are working remotely and I hope I was able to help them in some way. I started to tweet some tips and tricks with hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/remotelife?src=hash">#RemoteLife</a> which has triggered some good replies.

    I also gave a new presentation: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14GP__IrU9SeDGjpII4IjroiR0v6Y8L_s91KS02annao/edit?usp=sharing">Why You Need Some Chocolatey In Your Life</a>. I've been authoring Chocolatey packages for several years and using it for longer. I've had several ideas since to improve the content and I'm looking forward to submitting to future conferences.
